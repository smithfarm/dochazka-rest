The purpose of this package is to hold all the resource definitions
and provide a hook for loading them.

=cut

$defs->{'top'} = {

    # root resource
    '/' => {
        handler => 'handler_noop',
        acl_profile => 'passerby',
        description => 'The root resource',
        documentation => <<'EOH',
=pod

This resource is the parent of all resources that do not specify
a parent in their resource definition.
EOH

            GET => 'handler_bugreport',
        },
        acl_profile => 'passerby',
        cli => 'bugreport',
        description => 'Display instructions for reporting bugs in Web::MREST',
        documentation => <<'EOH',
=pod

Returns a JSON structure containing instructions for reporting bugs.
EOH
    },

    # configinfo
    'configinfo' =>
    {
        parent => '/',
        handler => {

        cli => 'configinfo',
        description => 'Display information about Web::MREST configuration',
        documentation => <<'EOH',

Returns a list of directories that were scanned for configuration files.
EOH

    # dbstatus
    'dbstatus' => {

        handler => {
            GET => 'handler_dbstatus',

        acl_profile => 'inactive',
        cli => 'dbstatus',
        description => 'Display status of database connection',
        documentation => <<'EOH',
=pod

This resource checks the employee's database connection and reports on its status.
The result - either "UP" or "DOWN" - will be encapsulated in a payload like this:

    { "dbstatus" : "UP" }

Each employee gets her own database connection when she logs in to Dochazka.
Calling this resource causes the server to execute a 'ping' on the connection.
If the ping test fails, the server will attempt to open a new connection. Only
if this, too, fails will "DOWN" be returned.

The resource takes a request body with one mandatory property, "path"
(corresponding to the path of a Mason component relative to the component
root), and one optional property, "parameters", which should be a hash
of parameter names and values.

The resource handler checks (1) if the component exists in the database,
(2) whether current employee has sufficient permissions to generate the
report (by comparing the employee's privlevel with the ACL profile of the
component), and (3) validates the parameters, if any, by applying the 
validation rules specified in the component object. Iff all of these
conditions are met, the component is called with the provided parameters.

With this resource, administrators can retrieve any employee's intervals

Before any records are returned, the tsrange is checked to see if it overlaps with
any privlevel or schedule changes - in which case an error is returned. This is so
interval report-generators do not have to handle changes in employee status.

By default, the number of intervals returned is limited to 500. This number
can be changed via the DOCHAZKA_INTERVAL_SELECT_LIMIT site configuration
parameter (set to 'undef' for no limit).

=item * C<desc> (optional interval description)

=item * C<remark> (optional remark)

If C<tsrange> is provided, C<datelist> should be omitted - and vice versa.

If C<dry_run> is true, the resource does not change the database state.

Deletes the interval object whose iid is specified by the ':iid' URI parameter.

will probably work as expected.

Used with POST to generate intervals according to an employee's schedule,
without actually creating any intervals - for example, to find out what
intervals are scheduled for a given day.

(This resource is very similar to C<interval/fillup>. The key difference is it
does not check for existing attendance intervals that might conflict. As a
result, it can easily produce conflicts if used with C<<dry_run => 0>> (false).  
If you want a list of non-conflicting intervals, use C<interval/fillup> with
C<<dry_run => 1>> (true).)

The request body takes the following parameters:

=over

=item * C<eid> (the EID of the employee to create intervals for; alternatively, C<nick> or C<sec_id>)

=item * C<tsrange> (the time span over which to create intervals)

With this resource, employees can retrieve their own attendance intervals 
over a given tsrange. 

Before any records are returned, the tsrange is checked to see if it overlaps with
any privlevel or schedule changes - in which case an error is returned. This is so
interval report-generators do not have to handle changes in employee status.

By default, the number of intervals returned is limited to 500. This number
can be changed via the DOCHAZKA_INTERVAL_SELECT_LIMIT site configuration
parameter (set to 'undef' for no limit).

Given a set of intervals, all of which must fall within a single contiguous
168-hour (7-day) period, this resource performs all actions necessary to either
create a new schedule from those intervals or verify that an equivalent
schedule already exists.

Sample JSON:

    { "schedule" : [
        "[2014-09-22 08:00, 2014-09-22 12:00)",
        "[2014-09-22 12:30, 2014-09-22 16:30)",
        "[2014-09-23 08:00, 2014-09-23 12:00)",
        "[2014-09-23 12:30, 2014-09-23 16:30)",
        "[2014-09-24 08:00, 2014-09-24 12:00)",
        "[2014-09-24 12:30, 2014-09-24 16:30)",
        "[2014-09-25 08:00, 2014-09-25 12:00)",
        "[2014-09-25 12:30, 2014-09-25 16:30)"
    ] }

(Optionally, an scode can be assigned by including an "scode" property.)

Read on for details:

First, a set of scratch intervals is created in the 'schedintvls' table.
If this succeeds, an INSERT operation is used to create a new record in the
'schedule' table. This operation has two possible successful outcomes 
depending on whether such a schedule already existed in the database, or not.
The status codes for these outcomes are DISPATCH_SCHEDULE_OK and
DISPATCH_SCHEDULE_INSERT_OK, respectively.

In both cases, the underlying scratch intervals are deleted automatically.
(All operations on the 'schedintlvs' table are supposed to be hidden from 
Dochazka clients.) 

Note that many sets of intervals can map to a single schedule (the conversion
process is only interested in the day of the week), so this resource may return
DISPATCH_SCHEDULE_OK more often than you think.

Whether or not the exact schedule existed already, if the underlying database
operation is successful the payload will contain three properties: 'sid' (the
SID assigned to the schedule containing the intervals), 'intervals' (the
intervals themselves), and 'schedule' (the intervals as they appear after being
converted into the format suitable for insertion into the 'schedule' table).

N.B. At present there is no way to just check for the existence of a schedule
corresponding to a given set of intervals.

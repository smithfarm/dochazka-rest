=head1 NAME

dochazka-ldap-batch-create - create Dochazka employee records for a list of LDAP users



=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quickly create three Dochazka employees, provided they are already in LDAP:

    dochazka-ldap-batch-create [one or more usernames]

For example:

    dochazka-ldap-batch-create perry
    dochazka-ldap-batch-create hans mojo avenger

The script should be run on an L<App::Dochazka::REST> server that has been
configured to use LDAP.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes there is a need to quickly create Dochazka employee records for an
arbitrary number of LDAP users.

For example, if "hans", "mojo", and "avenger" are valid LDAP users and the
local L<App::Dochazka::REST> instance has been properly configured to work with
an LDAP database, the following command will create three employees with nicks
"hans", "mojo", and "avenger":

    dochazka-ldap-batch-create hans mojo avenger

The employee's "sync" property will be set to true.

    }
    if ( ! ldap_exists( $_ ) ) {
        print "WARNING: $_ not found in LDAP database!\n";
        next;
    }
    my $emp = App::Dochazka::REST::Model::Employee->spawn(
        nick => $_,
        sync => 1,
    );
    my $status = $emp->insert( $faux_context );
    if ( $status->ok ) {
        print "$_ inserted successfully\n";
    } else {
        print "$_ not inserted because " . $status->text;
    }
}

exit( 0 );
